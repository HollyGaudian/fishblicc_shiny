# fishblicc Shiny


A shiny app to use with fishblicc package in fisheries length-frequency data analysis.

This is a work in progress. The software is being developed to provide an interactive application to allow users to edit the prior selectivity model within the `fishblicc` data object. While an interactive application is of limited use if simple selectivity functions are used, an interactive session should help when constructing selectivity mixtures which are needed to explain some length frequency data.


#1) plot length data as bar/histogram
#2) collect 2 parameters from clicking plot
#3) plot a normal selectivity curve over the data using the 2 parameter.
#4) reset and continue with other data sets
#5) potentially be able to seperate and analyse with fishing gears
